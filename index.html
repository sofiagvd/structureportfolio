    <p>I seek to expand my skills and knowledge with hands-on experience in the field of Journalism
and I do not believe there is a more suitable way than by the broadcasting company that I have
admired since I was able to understand news. For me, this industry means more than seeking
truthful current events, but knowing how to tell them. I wish to pursue a career in Journalism in
my country, one great experience at the time.
Furthermore, a large component of my studies is dedicated to being proactive, innovating, and
being efficient in multiple tasks. I have developed these skills in class, as well as, through my
various internships. Finally, after being part of the U-20 women national soccer team, I have
dedicated my time to being present in every sport event, knowledgeable of important athletes,
and aware of every sport organization’s essential decisions and news.</p>
